        The following tests could be made for the time12.java function:
        - Making a valid working time 12
        - Set time12 followed by: getHours, getMinutes, getAm_or_PM (successful AM and PM)
        - valid toString == 
        - correct Subtract (positive, negative, zero)
        - COULD do a lessThan case, its basically just calling upon subtract and is kind of redundant. 
        - COULD add potentially 'invalid' test cases and the exceptions they throw.
