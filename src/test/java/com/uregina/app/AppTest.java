    - Enter a proper departure date needs to be entered
    - Enter a proper airport arrival code
    - Enter a proper arrival date
    - Enter a proper arrival time
    - Then the 'user' will be propmted with the following:
    - Either a) add another flight and continue
    - Or b) print the ticket
    - Then the following will be asked:
    - A number for maximum flight count must be entered
    - A number for maximum flight time must be entered
    - A number for maximum layover time must be entered
    - Then the user must answer if they have a Schengen Visa or not
    (If the user does not then: )
    - and finally it will print valid or invalid based on checkticket.
